Shared Dependencies:

1. "role_hierarchy": This is a list of roles from smallest to highest. It is shared across all files as it is the basis for role prediction. 

2. "user_data": This is a dictionary containing user's current role, time in that role, and at least 3 other factors. It is used in "main.py", "role_predictor.py", "user_input.py", and "prediction_model.py".

3. "predict_role": This is a function defined in "role_predictor.py" that takes in "user_data" and returns a predicted role. It is used in "main.py" and "prediction_model.py".

4. "get_user_input": This is a function defined in "user_input.py" that prompts the user for their current role, time in that role, and other factors. It is used in "main.py" and "role_predictor.py".

5. "role_factors": This is a list of factors that influence role prediction. It is defined in "role_factors.py" and used in "role_predictor.py", "user_input.py", and "prediction_model.py".

6. "train_model": This is a function defined in "prediction_model.py" that takes in "user_data" and "role_hierarchy" to train the prediction model. It is used in "main.py" and "role_predictor.py".

7. "role_data": This is a dictionary defined in "role_data.py" that contains historical data about role transitions. It is used in "role_predictor.py" and "prediction_model.py".
